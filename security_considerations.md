- best would be to
always type in on restart, see (here)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39251648/best-practice-for-storing-passwords-for-automation/75049778#75049778]
memory is safe according to (this)[https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29019/are-passwords-stored-in-memory-safe]

- however, it doesn't have the most comfort to always type in the password, therefore
we save it in a file and the churchtool user saved don't have enough permissions to do any damage

- maybe there is some linux magic possible to hide the file behind a password but that's outside the scope of this project
